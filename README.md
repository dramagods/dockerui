## DockerUI with Authentication
DockerUI-with-Authentication is forked from DockerUI.

As you know, origional DockerUI on the server which can access to Internet is dangerous. This version just added `login` and `password` pages to make DockerUI safer on the Internet. 

By default, user name and password are both `admin`. You can change the user name or password by click `CHANGE PASSWORD` button in `SETTING` page.

## DockerUI

![Containers](/containers.png)
DockerUI is a web interface to interact with the Remote API.  The goal is to provide a pure client side implementation so it is effortless to connect and manage docker.  This project is not complete and is still under heavy development.

### Goals
* Little to no dependencies - I really want to keep this project a pure html/js app.  I know this will have to change so that I can introduce authentication and authorization along with managing multiple docker endpoints. 
* Consistency - The web UI should be consistent with the commands found on the docker CLI.

### Container Quickstart 

* Run `docker build -t crosbymichael/dockerui github.com/crosbymichael/dockerui`
* `docker run -d -p 9000:9000 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/docker.sock crosbymichael/dockerui -e /docker.sock`
* Open your browser to `http://<dockerd host ip>:9000`


Bind mounting the unix socket into the dockerui container is much more secure than exposing your docker 
daemon over tcp.  You should still secure your dockerui instance behind some type of auth.  Maybe running 
nginx infront of dockerui with basic auth.

### Connect via a unix socket
If you want to connect to docker via the unix socket you can pass the socket path to the `-e` variable.  If you are running dockerui in a container you can bind mount the unix socket into the container.

```bash
docker run -d -p 9000:9000 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/docker.sock crosbymichael/dockerui -e /docker.sock
```
